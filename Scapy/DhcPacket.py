"""In this example, we define the MAC address of the client and the DHCP options as a list of tuples.
We then use Scapy to build the DHCP packet by specifying the Ether, IP, UDP, BOOTP, and DHCP layers.
We set the source MAC address to a random value using the RandMAC() function, and set the destination MAC address to the broadcast address "ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff".
We set the source IP address to "0.0.0.0" and the destination IP address to "255.255.255.255".
We set the source and destination UDP port numbers to 68 and 67, respectively, which are the standard port numbers used for DHCP client and server communication.
We set the client hardware address (chaddr) to the MAC address of the client, and set the DHCP options to the list of tuples we defined earlier.

Finally, we use the srp1() function to send the DHCP packet and receive the response.
In this case, we set the verbose argument to False to suppress output to the console.
The response packet will be stored in the dhcp_offer variable.
